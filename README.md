Compartmental Model of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Transmission

With Vaccination, Treatment, Public Awareness & Optimal Control

Project Overview

This project presents a deterministic compartmental model for the transmission dynamics of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV).
The model incorporates:

Vaccination

Treatment

Public Awareness

Optimal Control Strategies

The study applies mathematical analysis, numerical simulations, stability theory, sensitivity analysis, and parameter estimation using Python.
